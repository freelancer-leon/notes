# System Mangement Mode
* SMM is a special-purpose operating mode provided for handling system-wide functions like
  * power management
  * system hardware control
  * proprietary OEM-designed code
* Intended for use
  * only by **system firmware**
  * not by
    * applications software
    * general-purpose systems software
* Main benefit
  * offers a distinct and easily isolated processor environment that operates transparently to
    * the operating system
    * executive and software applications
* When SMM is invoked through a **system management interrupt (SMI)**
  * the processor saves the current state of the processor (the processorâ€™s context)
  * then switches to a separate operating environment defined by a new address space
* The **system management software executive (SMI handler)** starts execution in that environment, and the critical code and data of the SMI handler reside in a **physical memory region (SMRAM)** within that address space
* While in SMM, the processor executes SMI handler code to perform operations such as
  * powering down unused disk drives or monitors
  * executing proprietary code
  * placing the whole system in a suspended state
* When the SMI handler has completed its operations, it executes a **resume (RSM)** instruction, which causes
  * the processor to reload the saved context of the processor
  * switch back to protected or real mode
  * resume executing the interrupted application or operating-system program or task
* The following SMM mechanisms make it transparent to applications programs and operating systems:
  * The only way to enter SMM is by means of an SMI.
  * The processor executes SMM code in a separate address space that can be made inaccessible from the other operating modes.
  * Upon entering SMM, the processor saves the context of the interrupted program or task.
  * All interrupts normally handled by the operating system are disabled upon entry into SMM.
  * The `RSM` instruction can be executed only in SMM.
* The execution environment after entering SMM is in **real address mode with paging disabled** (`CR0.PE = CR0.PG = 0`).
* In this initial execution environment, the SMI handler can
  * address up to `4 GBytes` of memory
  * execute all I/O and system instructions
